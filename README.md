# Archived coding projects and labs from the intro Python coding class CECS 174

# Project 1: intro program that displays information about the energy released by earthquakes

# Project 2: uses control structures to mimic a Water Utility Company computing the amount of gallons water used by customers and their billing cost depending on their customer code and water usage

# Project 3: uses iteration, integers, floats, strings, and conditional statements to simulate a Vending Machine Change Maker

# Project 4: creating small multiple functions to manipulate strings, more specifically manipulate the user's inputted name

# Project 4 Part 2: various different functions from A-Q made to manipulate the 'mobysmall' paragraph of text (more string manipulation)
